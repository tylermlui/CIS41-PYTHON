This program has the user guess a random number provided by the program. If the guess is correct it will notify the user and if the
guess is wrong it will notify the user if it is too low or too high. It will also tell the user the remaining number or tries left 
to guess the number.It uses functions to make sure the user doesn't enter a number lower than 1 or higher than 20 and will loop 
until the user has entered a number between 1 and 20.
